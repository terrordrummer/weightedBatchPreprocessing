v1.4.0
- light exposure tolerance flag replaces the "Group lights with different exposure"
- reference frame selected amog the files with the lowest binning
- bugfix: drizzle files not update by Image Integration process

v1.3.5
- Automatic light frame weights computation
- Automatic selection of the best reference frame for registration
- Multiple duration/filter/binning light frame groups processed
- "Group lights with different exposures" flag added to optionally group all light frames despite their duration
- Light frames are grouped by duration during calibration process to match the correct dark frame (useful when light frames with different exposure are grouped together)
- "auto" rejection option to select the best rejection strategy during integration
- Smart naming: BINNING, FILTER and EXPTIME can be added to file names or including folder to provide these values when no proper keywords are stored into frame files
- Flat frames are always calibrated with master bias if a matching master bias is provided
- Smart reporting: summary of operations shown at the end of the process
- Advanced diagnostic
- "Save frame groups on exit" flag added
