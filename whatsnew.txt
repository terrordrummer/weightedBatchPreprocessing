- automatic light weights computation
- automatic selection of reference frame
- multiple duration/filter/binning light frame groups processed
    - flag to group all light frames even with different duration (to avoid HDR, different exposures is reported)
- always calibrate flat with bias if provided
- calibration groups frames in a group by duration to match the correct dark frame (if frames with different durations are grouped)
- refresh dark grouping if exposure tolerance is changed
- refresh lights grouping if grouping flag is changed
